The Terraform No-Code Infrastructure Module for Azure Static Web Apps simplifies the deployment and management of Azure Static Web Apps without requiring deep Terraform expertise. This module provides a declarative, configuration-driven approach to provisioning web applications with built-in support for CI/CD, authentication, and global content delivery.

## Key features:
- No-code approach – Deploy infrastructure using simple configuration files, eliminating the need for custom Terraform scripts.
- Automated deployment – Seamless integration with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for continuous deployment.
- Flexible configuration – Supports various hosting options, including custom domains, staging environments, and backend API integrations.
- Security & compliance – Enables role-based access control (RBAC), authentication providers (GitHub, Azure AD, etc.), and networking configurations.
- Scalability & performance – Leverages Azure's global CDN and edge locations for faster content delivery.

## Use cases:
- Deploying front-end applications (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) without managing infrastructure.
- Hosting JAMstack applications with serverless APIs.
- Automating web app deployment via GitHub repositories.
